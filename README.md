# CAN-CLIP
The dataset was downloaded from the https://github.com/cs-chan/ArtGAN/tree/master/WikiArt%20Dataset and saved to my Google Drive. If there are access issues, I can provide it via email.

The implementation of the CAN was based on this repo: https://github.com/otepencelik/GAN-Artwork-Generation

Contents:

This zip file contains five Jupyter Notebook files:

Three different model implementations.
Two variations of Model 3, each using a different prompt.

Instructions:

Before running any of the code, please ensure that parameters.py is properly configured within the files. Additionally, make sure that the zip file is saved in the correct directory. The code was run using Google Colab, so it should be compatible with that environment.
